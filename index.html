      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The code for the head element is <strong>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</strong></li>
          </ul>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The code for the body element is <strong>&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</li></strong>
          </ul>
        <li>To better understand both HTML and CSS here is a series of videos by Kevin Powell on youtube, starting with my favorite explaining HTML as <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQuIIv2RVA&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM0xE0K2uZRvsM7LkIhsPT->Wrapping Paper</a></li>
        <li>When starting an index.html you must use <strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html/&gt;</li></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>In order to get <strong>&lt;, and /&gt;</strong> typed out instead of being mistaken as code you need to type out <strong><em>&amp;lt;
              and /&amp;gt;</em></strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>And to get <strong>&amp;</strong> typed out you'll need to use <strong>& amp;</strong> without the space, but only to properly display the code</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Next is setting the language of our HTML. We do this by using <strong>&lt;html lang="en"/&gt;</strong></li>
          </ul>
        <li>The HTML code to insert an image onto a page is <strong>&lt;image src="img file name here" alt"description of an
          image"/&gt;</strong></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>in order to have CSS working with HTML you need to create a link to your <strong>style.css</strong> file using <strong>&lt;link
          rel="stylesheet" href="'assets folder'"&gt;</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>if your images/assets aren't loading switch the order around</li>
          <li>you can file/order your assets however you want, but the folder/directory must be named correctly and
            specified</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>remember when using github inorder to deploy your code, you'll need a jekyll theme</li>
        <ul>
          <li>in order to create a jeykll theme you'll need a <strong>_config.yml file which you can create by manually adding
            a file in your repo. Name the file _config.yml then in the description add theme: jekyll-theme-'theme name'</strong>

        <li>Be calm. Relax. I know you may look back at this with a new mindset, a new age, a new path. But remember
          it's important to self reflect. Self reflections equals growth.</li>
        <li>The immediate answer isn't always the best answer, but sometimes it can lead to creative solutions through
          the problems they cause</li>
